## Decisions Detail

### phase-03-videos/TD-01

**Recommendation:** the retry/backoff semantics needed for TD-07 (failure handling) are native BullMQ features requiring zero custom code, the NestJS integration is decorator-based and idiomatic with the project's existing DI conventions, and Redis is a single, well-documented container — a modest addition to `compose.yaml` compared to RabbitMQ's operational surface. pg-boss avoids new infra but trades away NestJS-native ergonomics and mature tooling for a single-consumer, single-job-type workload where that trade isn't justified.
**Libraries:** @nestjs/bullmq, bullmq

### phase-03-videos/TD-02

**Recommendation:** **Client:** directly honors the project's own "MinIO now, S3 in production" plan with zero client-code migration cost, and `lib-storage`'s `Upload` class plus `s3-request-presigner` cover every storage need (presigned upload/download, multipart) documented for this phase. **Bucket organization:** no differentiated-policy requirement exists yet in Phase 03; a second bucket can be introduced later without touching key-generation logic (keys are already namespaced by video ID).
**Libraries:** @aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner, @aws-sdk/lib-storage

### phase-03-videos/TD-03

**Recommendation:** the only option that both satisfies the 10GB (and beyond) requirement and genuinely keeps the API out of the byte-transfer path. Flow: `POST /videos` creates the draft video row (`status: rascunho`) and a storage multipart upload, returning `videoId` + `uploadId` + presigned part URLs; the client PUTs parts directly to MinIO; `POST /videos/:id/complete-upload` completes the multipart upload and enqueues the processing job (TD-01), moving `status` to `processando`. **Note:** `title` is a required field on this draft-creation payload (resolved AMB-1).
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-04

**Recommendation:** the project's precedent for a *separate* public handle (the `Channel.nickname` column, distinct from `Channel.id`) exists specifically because channels need a memorable, user-chosen public identity. No such requirement exists for videos in this phase's capability list. Reusing the existing UUID costs nothing and defers a short-URL feature to a later phase if the product ever asks for one.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-05

**Recommendation:** the only option matching the architecture diagram's explicit separate Video Worker container while reusing 100% of the existing NestJS conventions (entities, config, storage client). `fluent-ffmpeg`'s `ffprobe()` and `screenshots()` cover the metadata-extraction and thumbnail-generation capabilities directly, confirmed against current documentation.
**Libraries:** fluent-ffmpeg

### phase-03-videos/TD-06

**Recommendation:** reuses S3/MinIO's already-correct `Range`/`206` implementation instead of re-implementing it, keeps the API stateless and out of the bandwidth path for both streaming and downloading, and is symmetric with the upload decision (TD-03): the API only ever brokers short-lived signed URLs, never the bytes themselves. **Note:** streaming/download endpoints are public (`@Public()`) for `status: pronto` videos, starting this phase (resolved AMB-2) — ahead of Fase 05's anonymous-viewing capability.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-07

**Recommendation:** a thin, standard use of the queue technology already chosen in TD-01, absorbing transient failures without any bespoke retry code, while still surfacing a genuine `erro` state (with the last failure reason) once retries are exhausted.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-08

**Recommendation:** the only option consistent with this project's already-established, explicit preference for real infrastructure in integration tests, and the only one that actually exercises TD-07's retry/backoff behavior. `QueueEvents.waitUntilFinished()` is a clean, documented, non-polling primitive for this — not a fragile ad hoc polling loop.
**Libraries:** —

## Inherited Decisions Detail

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/config) — Official, core-team-maintained, guaranteed NestJS 11 compatibility. The `registerAs()` factory pattern solves the TypeORM CLI sharing problem: the factory function can be imported as a plain function by `data-source.ts` while also serving as a DI injection token inside NestJS. Building a custom module recreates solved functionality; third-party packages carry maintenance risk.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/config@^4.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (Joi) — First-class integration with `@nestjs/config` via `validationSchema`, requiring zero custom wiring. Handles string-to-number coercion natively. Using a different tool for env validation vs. request validation is reasonable — env config is validated once at startup, DTOs are validated per-request. Zod is elegant but adds a third validation paradigm to the project.
**Libraries:** `joi@^17.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option B (Namespaced/grouped with registerAs) — The project roadmap explicitly calls for auth, email, and storage in upcoming phases. Namespaced configs provide clear file boundaries per domain, typed injection via `ConfigType<typeof databaseConfig>`, and natural scalability. The `registerAs()` factory is dual-purpose: DI token inside NestJS and plain importable function for `data-source.ts`. Initial files for Phase 01: `src/config/database.config.ts`, `src/config/app.config.ts`.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option A (Shared registerAs factory) — Natural outcome of choosing `@nestjs/config` with `registerAs`. The factory is already callable by design. `data-source.ts` imports it, calls `dotenv.config()`, then calls the factory. Zero duplication, minimal code, no extra abstraction.
**Libraries:** `dotenv` (transitive via `@nestjs/config`)

### phase-02-auth/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Argon2id — For a greenfield project in 2026, Argon2id is the OWASP-recommended choice. The native build dependency is a one-time Docker setup cost. The project has no legacy constraints favoring bcrypt. OWASP minimum: 19MiB memory, 2 iterations.
**Libraries:** `argon2@^0.41.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/passport) — The project plan includes only email/password auth for now, but the plugin architecture costs little and future phases may add social login. Aligns with official NestJS docs, making onboarding and maintenance easier.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation during implementation — custom guards were preferred over `@nestjs/passport` to keep the dependency surface smaller; social login is not on the near-term roadmap, so the plugin-architecture benefit did not justify the extra abstraction layer.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option A (Refresh Token Rotation) — Provides the strongest security model with automatic theft detection. The DB write overhead is acceptable for a video platform (auth refresh is infrequent vs. video operations). PostgreSQL is already in the stack, so no new infrastructure needed. Race conditions can be mitigated with a short grace period for the old token.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option B (Random Opaque Tokens in DB) — Revocability is important: when a user requests a new password reset, previous tokens should be invalidated. The DB table is trivial to implement, and the tokens table can also serve future needs (e.g., API keys). Keeps email tokens decoupled from the JWT auth system.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs-modules/mailer) — Best NestJS integration with minimal boilerplate. Supports SMTP (matching the architecture diagram), works with MailHog/Mailpit for local development without external dependencies, and scales to any SMTP provider in production. Template engine support (Handlebars) simplifies email formatting. No vendor lock-in.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs-modules/mailer@^2.x`, `handlebars@^4.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Option A (class-validator + class-transformer) — This is a backend-only project (no shared schemas with frontend), so Zod's single-source-of-truth advantage is less impactful. class-validator is the documented NestJS approach, and the project already uses decorators extensively (TypeORM entities, NestJS DI). Fewer integration surprises with NestJS 11.
**Libraries:** `class-validator@^0.14.x`, `class-transformer@^0.5.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Option A (Custom Domain Exception Filter) — Provides machine-readable error codes that the Next.js frontend can switch on, without the overhead of RFC 9457's URI-based type system. The project is single-consumer (first-party frontend), so a simple `{ statusCode, error, message }` format with domain codes balances clarity and simplicity. The custom filter cost is low — two small files.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-08

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/throttler) — Native NestJS integration is decisive: the guard system allows scoping rate limiting to `AuthModule` only via module-level `APP_GUARD`, with `@SkipThrottle()` for exemptions. The project is single-instance with no distributed requirements, so in-memory storage is sufficient. Using express-rate-limit would bypass NestJS's DI and guard lifecycle for no clear benefit.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/throttler@^6.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-09

**Recommendation:** Option B (Opaque) — Since DB lookup is mandatory (TD-03), JWT signature adds no security value. Opaque tokens are shorter, leak no data, and are simpler to generate.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation — JWT was kept to reuse the access-token signing/verification infrastructure (`@nestjs/jwt`), trading token size and base64-readability for a single token format across the codebase.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-10

**Recommendation:** Option A — The platform is a video sharing service with URL-based channel handles. A strict `[a-z0-9_]` allowlist is the simplest and most portable choice: no extra dependencies, no edge cases around hyphen positioning, and the `user_<random>` fallback provides a valid handle even for extreme email prefixes. Hyphens can always be added in a future iteration if user feedback justifies it.
**Libraries:** —

_Note: `phase-02-auth-frontend` TDs (TD-01 through TD-07) are frontend-scoped (session/BFF/form-library decisions) and are not carried into this backend-only phase's inherited detail — they are irrelevant to queue/storage/upload/streaming/worker decisions. Full list available in `docs/phases/phase-02-auth-frontend/context.md` if a later phase needs it._

## Inherited Conventions

- Backend config uses `@nestjs/config` with namespaced `registerAs(name, () => ({...}))` factories — one file per domain in `src/config/`. _(from phase 01)_
- Env variables are validated by a Joi schema in `src/config/env.validation.ts`, passed to `ConfigModule.forRoot({ validationSchema, validationOptions })`. _(from phase 01)_
- Config is injected into modules via `ConfigType<typeof xxxConfig>` and `@Inject(xxxConfig.KEY)`; the same factory is importable as a plain function for `data-source.ts`. _(from phase 01)_
- `data-source.ts` loads `.env` via `import 'dotenv/config'` at the top, then imports `databaseConfig` and calls it as a plain function. _(from phase 01)_
- Database connection parameters (host, port, etc.) are sourced from a single `databaseConfig` factory — never duplicated between `AppModule` and `data-source.ts`. _(from phase 01)_
- `TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync` is used (not `forRoot`), with `imports: [ConfigModule]`, `inject: [databaseConfig.KEY]`, `useFactory` returning options. _(from phase 01)_

## Inherited Deferred Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Origin phase | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Telas de frontend | deferred | phase-01-configuracao-base | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha | deferred | phase-02-auth | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| "Confirmação de conta via e-mail com link de ativação" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — UI landing screen de-scoped 2026-05-14; FE confirmation flow (TD-07) picked up by a future phase. BE side unchanged in `phase-02-auth`. |
| "Logout" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — logout button lives inside authenticated chrome (typically Phase 04). Phase 02 still implements POST `/api/auth/logout` (BFF route handler + `session.destroy()`) so the contract is ready when the chrome lands. |
| "Recuperação de senha (destination screen / set-new-password)" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — `/forgot-password` ships this phase sending the e-mail; the reset-password destination screen is absent from Figma → link destination remains a 404 until a later phase delivers the screen via `/screen-inventory` extension run. |
| "Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | The umbrella bullet's full coverage requires the confirmação and reset-password destination screens; both are deferred per rows above. The 3 ship-this-phase telas (signup, login, forgot-password) are inventoried and covered by their own verbs; the umbrella bullet itself is deferred to the phase that lands the missing screens. |

## Non-UI / Deferred Capabilities

_None._

## Testing Requirements

### nestjs-project

| Artifact created | Required tests |
|---|---|
| Entity (`*.entity.ts`) | Integration: constraints, defaults, `select: false` |
| Service with branching + DB | Unit: branch logic (mock repo) + Integration: DB contract |
| Service with DB only (no branching) | Integration: DB contract |
| Service with configured lib (JWT, cache) | Unit: real lib with test config |
| Service with side-effect dep (email, storage) | Integration: real capture service (Mailpit) or local adapter |
| Module with configured imports | Unit: compilation test |
| Controller | E2E only — do NOT write unit tests |
| DTO | E2E: one validation wiring test per endpoint |
| Guard (delegates to service for business logic) | E2E + Unit if complex internal logic |
| Guard (simple, delegates to Passport) | E2E only |
| Strategy (Passport) | E2E via guard |
| Pipe (custom transformation/validation) | Unit |
| Interceptor (response transform, logging) | Unit and/or E2E |
| Exception Filter | Unit + E2E |
| Middleware | E2E |

_Note: the guide's `references/external-systems.md` was updated (2026-07-12, resolving ICC-1) to document Object Storage as real MinIO via Docker and Message Queue as real BullMQ + Redis via Docker, matching this phase's decided TD-02/TD-01/TD-08 — no remaining divergence._
